Project Brief

You work for a company 'X', an asset management company. 'X' wants to make investments in a few companies. The CEO of 'X' wants to understand the global 
trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively.

Business and Data Understanding

'X' has two minor constraints for investments:
1. It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment
2. It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in
* For your analysis, consider a country to be English speaking only if English is one of the official languages in that country
